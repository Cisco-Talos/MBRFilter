MBRFilter

A simple disk filter based on Microsoft's diskperf and classpnp example drivers.

The goal of this filter is to prevent writing to Sector 0 on disks.
This is useful to prevent malware that overwrites the MBR like Petya.

This driver will prevent writes to sector 0 on all drives. This can cause an 
issue when initializing a new disk in the Disk Management application. Hit 
'Cancel' when asks you to write to the MBR/GPT and it should work as expected.
Alternatively, if OK was clicked, then quitting and restarting the application
will allow partitoning/formatting.


To install: right click the inf file, select 'install' and reboot when prompted.
To access sector 0 on drive 0: boot into Safe Mode. 
To compile: make sure to set:

    MBRFilter properties -> Configuration properties -> Driver Signing -> General
        Sign mode: Test Sign
        Test certificate: generate or select one from your store.

To remove MBRFilter, follow these steps:

- Remove the line MBRFilter from the UpperFilters registry key in (only
  remove MBRFilter, there might be other disk drivers here):

HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4d36e967-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}

- Reboot


AccessMBR

Simple program to read sector 0 on Physical drive 0 and write that sector back.
Used as a testing program for MBRFilter. This overwrites your MBR, it will 
restore it once it's done. 
Nevertheless: USE WITH CAUTION.
